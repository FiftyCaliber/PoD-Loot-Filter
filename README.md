# Path of Diablo Loot Filter
This is my own version of Synial's Standard Loot Filter **v1.3.5b** intended for personal use, but of course anyone can else use it if they would like to.

#### Differences
* Healing Potions all changed from `Heal` to `Life`.
* Changed the name of some utility items due to not liking how short and therefore more difficult to click they were.
  * Greater and Super Healing/Mana Potions changed from `!H`/`!H+`/`!M`/`!M+` to `!Great Life`/`!Super Life`/`!Great Mana`/`!Super Mana`.
  * Rejuvination Potions changed from `r 30%`/`R 70%` to `!Rejuvination`/`!Super Rejuvination`
  * Identifying/Town Portal Scrolls changed from `!TP`/`!ID` to `TP Scroll`/`ID Scroll`.
* Identifying/Town Portal Scrolls no longer drop on characters above level 15.
* Antidote/Thaw Potions no longer drop at all.
* Hardcoded rune number to each rune name. Example: `El [01]`
* Gold shown changed from 4000+ to 5000+.
* Grand Charms with the iLvl of 91 or higher now display it in red text after the name. Example: `Grand Charm [L99]`

#### Minor Fixes
* Socket display was not showing on some Necromancer Heads, Sorceress Orbs, Wands, Staves, and Scepters.
* Non-magic 0 and 3 socketed `Greater Claws` and `Suwayyah` were showing up as blue text.
